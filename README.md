# Assignment-1 Counter Application
This project is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of **Class Components** and **Functional Components**. Both components implement a **counter** with increment (`+`) and decrement (`-`) buttons.  

## ✨ Features
- Main heading: **"Assignment-2 Counter Application"**
- Shows both **Class Component** and **Function Component** side by side (row layout).
- Each component has:
  - Counter value
  - Increment button
  - Decrement button (number will not go below 0)
- Attractive UI design with buttons and layout.
